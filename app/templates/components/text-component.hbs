          Native application development is usually current practice in enterprise. It takes multiple teams to maintain a single project, as the same application has to be developed for each platform by an individual team. Your organization has to hire specialists for each technology users are using, from Windows to Mac, Linux to Android, or iOS to Windows Phone. Once an application is built your organization has to wait for a Google or Apple to approve your application for distribution on their app stores, and then wait for approval for every update after that. If your organization happened to hire a consultant to develop for one platform and then leaves after it is built, it is highly likely that the application will not be maintained properly and may even become useless.

          In the ideal enterprise development environment, organizations should be able to solve these problems with distribution, reengagement, upgrading and maintaining multiple code bases. Enterprise should be able to instantly deploy changes to all of their supported platforms without waiting for approval. With a single codebase, enterprise should be able to target mobile, tablet and desktop devices no matter what operating system they run. Furthermore, these applications should be easily discoverable and able to be placed on users’ home screens while also being able to perform background functionality, like sending important updates and alerts with push notifications. Finally, these applications should support workers in the field with intermittent network activity with offline support.

          The belief is that web applications lack the ease of use and reliability of native applications, but all of these features are in fact possible and actually relatively easy to implement, and we can do so without making managing enterprise application development the nightmare it has become. Allow me to make the case for Progressive Web Applications for enterprise.
